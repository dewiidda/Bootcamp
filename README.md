Abstraction in C# refers to the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user. It allows us to create more generic and reusable code by focusing on the essential features of an object or class. In C#, abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes and interfaces.

Why Use Abstraction?
To achieve security: Hide certain details and only show important information about an object.
To create generic code: Abstract classes and interfaces allow us to define common behavior that can be shared across different classes.
